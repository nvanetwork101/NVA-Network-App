Part 1: How to Back Up (Export) Your Database
This process creates a complete snapshot of your database at a specific moment in time and saves it to a secure location in Google Cloud Storage.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Go to the Google Cloud Console: This is different from the Firebase console. Use this specific URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/import-export (You may need to select your nvanetworkapp project if you have multiple projects).
Click "Export": You will see buttons for "Import" and "Export". Click the Export button.
Choose "Export entire database": This option will be pre-selected.
Choose a Destination: The console will ask you to specify a Cloud Storage "bucket". Your project already has a default one. Click "Browse", select the bucket that looks like nvanetworkapp.appspot.com, and then click "Export".
The process will now begin. It might take a few minutes depending on the size of your database. You can monitor its progress on that same page. Once it's complete, you have a full backup of every piece of data.



Part 2: How to Restore (Import) Your Database
If something ever goes wrong, you can use the backup you just created to restore your database to the exact state it was in when you exported it.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Go back to the same page: https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/import-export
Click "Import": This time, click the Import button.
Find Your Backup: Click "Browse" and navigate to the folder that was created by your export process. It will have a timestamped name (e.g., 2025-10-12T20:00:00_12345). Select the file that ends in .overall_export_metadata.
Confirm the Import: The console will show you what you are about to import. Click "Import" to begin the restoration process.
CRITICAL WARNING: When you import, it will overwrite any data currently in your database that has the same document ID as the data in your backup. This is why it's a perfect "restore" toolâ€”it puts things back exactly as they were, erasing any changes made since the backup.
My Strong Recommendation
Do a Manual Export NOW: Follow the "Part 1" steps right now, before you do anything else. This will be your safety net.
Run the Reset Function: Once the export is complete, you can safely proceed with running the deleteAllUserDataAndContent function we've built.
Enable Automated Backups for the Future: For long-term safety, you can also enable Firebase's "Point-in-Time Recovery" (PITR) feature. This is like a time machine for your database, automatically saving versions of your data so you can restore to any single minute in the past week. It's a paid feature, but it's very inexpensive and provides incredible peace of mind once your app is live with real users. You can find it in your Firestore database settings.
